## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: HSL(210, 67%, 54%) - RGB(#499df2) A vibrant blue to reflect trust and reliability in accessing tender information.
- Background color: HSL(210, 15%, 95%) - RGB(#f2f4f7) A very light blue to provide a clean and professional backdrop.
- Accent color: HSL(180, 50%, 50%) - RGB(#40bfbf) A contrasting aquamarine to highlight interactive elements.
- Font pairing: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for headlines and body text, to create a modern, clean and objective aesthetic.
- Use crisp, professional icons relevant to tenders and business, such as briefcases, documents, and location markers. Icons should use the accent color to stand out.
- The layout is modeled after modern chat interfaces like ChatGPT. Fixed input box with scrolling content above. Collapsible sidebar navigation on the left.
- Smooth transitions and animations for the sidebar and interactive elements. Use micro-interactions to provide feedback on user actions.
